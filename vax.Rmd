The [New York Time vaccine tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html)
currently shows a predicted proportion of people vaccinated if vaccination continues
"at the current pace", using a linear projection. I thought it might be helpful to try to 
add some uncertainty to that line in a way that does not assume a linear trend.

## Libraries needed for this analysis:

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(ggdist)
library(tidybayes)
library(bsts)
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(posterior)   # pak::pkg_install("stan-dev/posterior")
library(future)
library(furrr)

theme_set(theme_ggdist())
```

## The data

I downloaded the data on what share of the population has recieved at least one dose from
[ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states#what-share-of-the-population-has-received-at-least-one-dose-of-the-covid-19-vaccine):

```{r fetch_data, eval = FALSE}
download.file(
  "https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/raw/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv", 
  "share-people-vaccinated-covid.csv"
)
```

Filtering down just to the US:

```{r df}
df = read.csv("share-people-vaccinated-covid.csv") %>%
  filter(location == "United States") %>%
  transmute(
    date = as_date(date),
    day = as.numeric(date - min(date)),
    vax = people_vaccinated_per_hundred / 100
  )

head(df)
```

The data looks like this:

```{r raw_data, fig.width = 7.11, fig.height = 4}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, vax)) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```

## NYT-like linear model

First off, we can approximate what NYT is doing using linear regression based on
the last couple of points (this doesn't line up exactly with their model but it seems
close):

```{r nyt_like, fig.width = 7.11, fig.height = 4}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, vax)) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +
  stat_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm, se = FALSE, data = . %>% filter(row_number() > n() - 8), fullrange = TRUE) +
  scale_x_date(limits = c(min(df$date), make_date(2021, 10, 31))) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = make_date(2021, 10, 12), alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.9, alpha = 0.2) +
  annotate("text", x = make_date(2021, 5, 28), y = 0.92, label = "90%", hjust = 0, vjust = 0, size = 3.5) +
  annotate("text", x = make_date(2021, 10, 8), y = 0.5, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, label = "Oct 12", size = 3.5) 
```

However, instead of doing this I am going to fit a time series model to the data.

## Data prep for time series model of daily changes

Analyzing the data on the raw scale is hard because (1) we
know that the percent of vaccinated people is bounded between 0 and 1 and (2)
we know that the percent of vaccinated people is always increasing. Combining these
two facts, we could instead look at the difference in the logit of the
percent of vaccinated people:

```{r diff_plot, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 7.11, fig.height = 4}
df_diff = df %>%
  select(-date) %>%
  complete(day = min(day):max(day)) %>%
  mutate(date = min(df$date) + days(day))

df_diff %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, c(NA, diff(qlogis(vax))))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "daily increase in logit(Percent vaccinated)")
```

Since we know that this difference must be positive (since the number of vaccinated
people cannot decrease), we might analyse this on a log scale. That
might also stabilize the variance:

```{r log_diff_plot, fig.width = 7.11, fig.height = 4}
df_log_diff = df_diff %>%
  mutate(log_diff_vax = c(NA, log(diff(qlogis(vax))))) %>%
  slice(-1)

df_log_diff %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, log_diff_vax)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(y = "log(daily increase in logit(Percent vaccinated))")
```

There's some missing data here, which we'll let the model impute (FWIW I also
tried just using linear interpolation on the raw data prior to translating it
into differences and got very similar results to the imputation approach).

## Time series model

This seems a good point to fit a time series model. We'll fit a Bayesian Structural
Time Series model with `bsts()`. We'll use a semi-local
linear trend [intended for long-term forecasting](https://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2017/07/fitting-bayesian-structural-time-series.html).
There's a clear weekly trend in the numbers, which is to be expected given
differences in vaccination rates on the weekend, so we'll also include a seasonal
component with a 7-day period. Since we're on
a log scale even changes by as much as 0.5 or 1 are large, we'll use some 
tight-ish-looking priors here:

```{r model}
fit_model = function(max_date = max(df_log_diff$date)) {
  with(filter(df_log_diff, date <= max_date), bsts(log_diff_vax, 
    state.specification = list() %>%
      AddSemilocalLinearTrend(log_diff_vax,
        level.sigma.prior = SdPrior(0.5, 1),
        slope.mean.prior = NormalPrior(0,0.5),
        initial.level.prior = NormalPrior(0,0.5),
        initial.slope.prior = NormalPrior(0,0.5),
        slope.sigma.prior = SdPrior(0.5, 1),
        slope.ar1.prior = Ar1CoefficientPrior(0, 0.5)
      ) %>%
      AddSeasonal(log_diff_vax, 7, 
        sigma.prior = SdPrior(0.5, 1)
      ),
    prior = SdPrior(0.5, 1),
    niter = 40000,
    seed = 4272021 # for reproducibility
  ))
}

m = fit_model()
```

Some diagnostics: 

```{r}
draws = as_draws(do.call(cbind, m[startsWith(names(m), "trend") | startsWith(names(m), "sigma")]))
summary(draws, median, mad, quantile2, default_convergence_measures())
```

The $\hat{R}$s and effective sample sizes look reasonable.

```{r}
bayesplot::mcmc_trace(draws)
```

Trace plots also look reasonable.

## Predictions

Now we'll generate fits and predictions for a 180-day forecast:

```{r predictions}
forecast_days = 180

calc_fits = function(model = m, max_date = max(df_diff$date)) {
  df_log_diff %>%
    filter(date <= max_date) %>%
    add_draws(colSums(aperm(model$state.contributions, c(2, 1, 3))))
}
fits_all = calc_fits()

calc_pred_diff = function(model = m, max_date = max(df_diff$date)) {
  tibble(date = max_date + days(1:forecast_days)) %>%
    add_draws(predict(model, horizon = forecast_days)$distribution, value = "log_diff_vax")
}
pred_diff_all = calc_pred_diff()
```

Predictions from the model look like this (with imputed missing data in gray):

```{r predictions_plot, fig.width = 7.11, fig.height = 4}
x_dates = seq(make_date(2021, 1, 1), max(pred_diff_all$date), by = "month")
x_scale = function(...) list(
  scale_x_date(
    limits = range(df_diff$date, pred_diff_all$date),
    breaks = x_dates,
    labels = months(x_dates, abbreviate = TRUE)
  ),
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE, ...) 
)

summer_line = geom_vline(xintercept = make_date(2021, 9, 22), alpha = 0.25)

widths = c(.5, .8, .95)

plot_pred_diff = function(fits = fits_all, pred_diff = pred_diff_all) {
  pred_diff %>%
    ggplot(aes(date, log_diff_vax)) +
    stat_lineribbon(aes(y = .value, fill_ramp = stat(level)), data = fits, fill = "gray75", color = "gray65") +
    stat_lineribbon(.width = widths, color = "#08519c") +
    geom_line(data = df_log_diff, size = 1) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = min(pred_diff$date) - days(1), color = "gray75") +
    # summer_line +
    scale_fill_brewer() +
    theme_ggdist() +
    x_scale(ylim = c(-20, 5)) +
    labs(
      subtitle = "log(daily increase in logit(Percent vaccinated))",
      y = NULL,
      x = NULL
    )  
}
plot_pred_diff()
```

There is quite a bit of uncertainty here, especially for far-out forecasts.

We can translate these predictions of differences into predictions of percent
vaccinated by inverting the log, cumulatively summing differences in log odds,
then inverting the logit transformation:

```{r pred_vax}
calc_pred_vax = function(pred_diff = pred_diff_all) {
  last_observed_vax = df_diff %>%
    filter(date == min(pred_diff$date) - days(1)) %$%
    vax
  
  pred_diff %>%
    group_by(.draw) %>%
    mutate(
      vax = plogis(cumsum(c(
        qlogis(last_observed_vax) + exp(log_diff_vax[[1]]),
        exp(log_diff_vax[-1])
      )))
    )
}
pred_vax_all = calc_pred_vax()
```

Now we can plot the latent model alongside predictions of vaccination rate and
the predicted probability that the proportion of vaccinated people is above
some threshold (say, 70%):

```{r model_breakdown, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 7}
plot_vaxed = function(pred_vax = pred_vax_all) {
  pred_vax %>%
    ggplot(aes(date, vax)) +
    stat_lineribbon(.width = widths, color = "#08519c") +
    scale_fill_brewer() +
    geom_line(data = df_diff, size = 1) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = .7, alpha = 0.25) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = min(pred_vax$date) - days(1), color = "gray75") +
    # summer_line +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1), labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    x_scale() +
    theme_ggdist() +
    annotate("text", x = make_date(2020, 12, 28), y = 0.72, label = "70%", hjust = 0, vjust = 0, size = 3.25) +
    # annotate("text", x = make_date(2021, 9, 19), y = 0.25, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, label = "Sept 22\n End of summer", size = 3.25, lineheight = 1.05) +
    labs(
      subtitle = "Percent vaccinated (at least one dose)",
      y = NULL,
      x = NULL
    )
}

vaxed = plot_vaxed()

diffs = plot_pred_diff()

prob = pred_vax_all %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(prob_vax_gt_70 = mean(vax > .70)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, prob_vax_gt_70)) +
  geom_line(color = "#08519c", size = 1) +
  theme_ggdist() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, alpha = 0.25) +
  # summer_line +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1), labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  x_scale() +
  labs(
    subtitle = "Pr(Percent vaccinated > 70%)",
    y = NULL,
    x = NULL
  )

vaxed / diffs / prob
```

This gives us a final chart like this:

```{r vaxed_plot, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 7.11, fig.height = 4}
vaxed +
  stat_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm, se = FALSE,
    data = df %>% filter(row_number() > n() - 8), 
    fullrange = TRUE, color = scales::alpha("white", 0.5), size = 1
  ) +
  annotate("text", 
    label = "white line=\nlinear model  ", 
    fontface = "bold", x = make_date(2021, 9, 12), y = .89, color = "black", hjust = 1, size = 3.25, lineheight = 1.05
  ) +
  labs(
    subtitle = "Forecasted % US with at least one dose, from time series model of daily increase in log odds"
  )
```

Anyway, my conclusion from all of this is essentially that there is *a lot* of
uncertainty in what the vaccination rate will be, at least if we just look at the raw numbers,
and doubtless the model I've shown here is way oversimplified --- but I have 
some trepidation about looking at even simpler models (like linear projections) 
and ignoring their uncertainty, as this is probably going to be at least a little misleading.


## Model comparison

For comparison purposes, let's fit the model on data up to a few different
dates and see how it did on the data we've already observed.

```{r eval = FALSE}
plan(multisession)

models = tibble(
  upto = seq(as.Date("2021-03-01"), max(df$date), by = 15),
  model = future_map(upto, fit_model)
) 
```

Then build the charts for each model:

```{r eval = FALSE}
plots = map2(models$model, models$upto, function(m, max_date) {
  fits = calc_fits(m, max_date)
  pred_diff = calc_pred_diff(m, max_date)
  pred_vax = calc_pred_vax(pred_diff)
  list(
    vaxed = plot_vaxed(pred_vax),
    diffs = plot_pred_diff(fits, pred_diff)
  )
})

plots[[length(plots) + 1]] = list(
  vaxed = vaxed,
  diffs = diffs
)
```

And put them together into an animation:

```{r eval = FALSE}
png_path <- file.path("model_plots", "plot%03d.png")
png(png_path, type = "cairo", width = 1000, height = 1000, res = 200)
for (p in plots) {
  print(p$vaxed / p$diffs)
}
dev.off()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
png_files <- sprintf(png_path, seq_along(plots))
gifski::gifski(png_files, "model_plots/animated.gif", width = 1000, height = 1000)
```


```{r}
gganimate::gif_file("model_plots/animated.gif")
```
